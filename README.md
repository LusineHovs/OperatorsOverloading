# OperatorsOverloading

In *Operators Overloading* folder you can find some very simple example of '+', '*' operators overloading using *Vectors*.

**Using**

Below you can see the *Testing code*:

```C#
Vector vector1 = new Vector(9);
Vector vector2 = new Vector(10);
Vector vectorSum = vector1 + vector2;
Vector vectorProduct = vector1 * vector2;
Console.WriteLine($"The sum of two vectors = {vectorSum}.");
Console.WriteLine($"The sum of two vectors = {vectorProduct}.");
```
